# Benchmarks for .NET

This repository contains several benchmarks, which were implemented using BenchmarkDotNet.

## Usage

To run Benchmarks in a certain namespace or by name, simply run:

```
dotnet run -c Release --filter *<filter>*
```

and replace '<filter>' with a part of the name or namespace.
